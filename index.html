    <h1><span class= "highlight">I found this article quite interesting,</span> more so the quote at the very beginning really stuck with me because it has always been something I’ve thought about.</h1>

     <h2>I never knew the exact percentage of 93% however, but as I entered college, I did increasingly begin to think about how the design field is overwhelmingly white and where, as a <span class= "highlight">black female</span>, l do I fit in with my own background and perspectives.</h2>

     <h3>For a long time, I’ve always considered design to be somewhat of a selfless career in the aspect that, the designer to working to create not for themselves, but for others.</h3>

     <h4>But when you start to look at the designers who are supposed to be designing for me, and others who also look like me. It’s sometimes hard to think about how they will do so effectively when there’s <span class= "highlight">no representation of who I am in design</span> to even consider creating design to connect to people of color. </h4>

     <h5>I found the analogy of Helvetica and the stereotypical white, heterosexual male to be humorous. </h5>

     <h6>As someone who really appreciates clean lines and design, I’ve never had a huge problem with Helvetica, I think it definitely does stands as a symbol for Modernist design in some ways. But I would also agree with Stefan Sagmeister in that it certainly has the ability to bore you and oftentimes does reek of <span class="highlight"> masculine whiteness.</span></h6>

     <p>This can also be a huge reason why so many people still respond to it now.</p>
